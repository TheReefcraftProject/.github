# Welcome to The Reefcraft Project
### *A Collaborative Effort to Simulate Physically Based Corals*

Reefcraft is an **open-source project** focused on creating scientifically grounded simulations of **physically based corals**. Our mission is to encode the principles of coral growth and behavior into a platform that can support research, creativity, and restoration efforts.

This project is a collaborative endeavor open to **scientists**, **artists**, **aquarium hobbyists**, and anyone passionate about the beauty and complexity of coral ecosystems. Together, we aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in simulating coral morphology and reef environments.

## About the Project
Reefcraft's foundation lies in a commitment to **scientific accuracy** and a deep appreciation for the natural world. Using advanced **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** and **chemistry modeling**, Reefcraft simulates the processes that shape coral growth over time. The project is volumetric in its approach, allowing us to model corals in their three-dimensional environments with precision.

Our **physically based corals** prioritize realism, offering a tool that serves both scientific inquiry and artistic expression. While the platform is still evolving, it is designed to grow through community contributions and shared knowledge.

## Goals
- **Short-Term Goal:** Develop a simulator capable of producing **physically based corals** with scientifically valid behaviors and structures.
- **Long-Term Goal:** Expand the project into a fully realized **ALife habitat**, capturing the intricate dynamics of reef ecosystems.

## Why Participate?
Reefcraft is not just software—it's a collaborative experiment. By contributing, you are part of an effort to:
- Simulate coral growth in ways that reflect their physical and biological reality.
- Explore the potential of coral ecosystems as digital tools for research, conservation, and creativity.
- Build an open platform for understanding and appreciating coral morphology at a fine-grain level.

We welcome participation from all backgrounds, whether you're contributing code, scientific data, creative designs, or simply curiosity.
